# backstage-bot

## What is backstage-bot?
It connects people on slack by assigning two people to talk. It will follow meetings and recommend new people to talk to each other. It's similar to the donut bot.

## No servers/DB
It just runs as a GitHub action (cron) with a local DB. So no servers, no DBMS. Just this repository and slack!
